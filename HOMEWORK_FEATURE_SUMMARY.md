## 📝 Configuration Requirements

### User Setup
1. **Gemini API Key Required:**
   - Users must configure their Google Gemini API key
   - Navigate to Settings (`/api-settings`)
   - Add key under "Google Gemini API"
   - Key is stored encrypted in `user_api_keys` table

### Environment Variables
No additional environment variables needed beyond existing Supabase configuration:
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

### Database Setup
Run the migration:
```sql
-- Applied via: supabase/migrations/20250201000000_homework_helper.sql
```

Ensure the `homework-images` storage bucket exists with proper RLS policies.

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
1. **Upload Phase:**
   - User selects/captures image
   - Optional editing (crop, rotate, adjust)
   - File uploaded to Supabase Storage
   - Upload record created in database

2. **Processing Phase:**
   - Image converted to base64
   - Sent to Google Gemini Vision API
   - AI analyzes image and generates structured response
   - Analysis and solution stored in database
   - Upload status updated to 'completed'

3. **Display Phase:**
   - Full result retrieved from database
   - Solution rendered with LaTeX support
   - User can view, save, export, or ask follow-up questions

### Storage Structure
```
homework-images/
  {user_id}/
    {timestamp}.{ext}
```

### Security Features
- ✅ User-scoped access via RLS
- ✅ Authenticated uploads only
- ✅ API keys encrypted in database
- ✅ Storage policies enforce user folder isolation
- ✅ Optional auto-delete after 30 days

## 🚀 Usage

### For Students
1. Navigate to "Homework" in main navigation
2. Click "Take Photo" or "Choose File" to upload homework
3. (Optional) Edit image - crop, rotate, adjust brightness/contrast
4. Click "Get AI Solution"
5. Wait for processing (typically 10-30 seconds)
6. Explore comprehensive solution with:
   - Problem restatement
   - Concept overview
   - Step-by-step explanation
   - Common mistakes
   - Related concepts
   - Practice problems
   - Learning resources
7. View past uploads in the "History" tab

### For Developers
```typescript
import {
  uploadHomeworkImage,
  createHomeworkUpload,
  analyzeHomeworkImage,
  getHomeworkResult,
} from '@/lib/homeworkService';

// Upload and analyze homework
const imageUrl = await uploadHomeworkImage(file, userId);
const upload = await createHomeworkUpload(userId, imageUrl, file.name, file.size, file.type);
const { analysis, solution } = await analyzeHomeworkImage(file, upload.id, apiKey);

// Retrieve result
const result = await getHomeworkResult(uploadId);
```

## 📊 Performance Considerations
- ✅ Images resized before upload (client-side)
- ✅ Solutions cached in database for instant re-access
- ✅ Lazy loading for history images
- ✅ Efficient database queries with proper indexing
- ✅ Optimistic UI updates

## 🐛 Known Limitations
1. Single image upload per submission (multi-image UI ready but backend logic incomplete)
2. No usage limits enforced yet (structure ready for subscription tiers)
3. Integration placeholders for Chat, Notes, and PDF export
4. Processing time depends on Gemini API response (typically 10-30 seconds)
5. Handwriting recognition quality depends on image clarity
