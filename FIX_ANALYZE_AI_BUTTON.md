# Fix for Analyze AI Button - API Key Detection Issue

## Problem
The analyze AI button on the homework page was incorrectly showing "No Gemini API key found in your account!" error even though the API key was present in the database/localStorage.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by stale state management:

1. **Initial Load**: The `loadApiKey()` function was called only once when the component mounted (in `useEffect`)
2. **Stale State**: The function loaded the API key into the `apiKey` state variable
3. **User Flow Issue**: When a user:
   - Visited the homework page (API key loaded into state, or not if it didn't exist yet)
   - Went to `/api-settings` and added their Gemini API key
   - Returned to the homework page
   - The `apiKey` state was still stale (either null or the old value) because the `useEffect` didn't re-run
4. **Button Click**: When clicking "Analyze with AI", the `handleProcess()` function checked the stale `apiKey` state and incorrectly showed the error

## Solution
Modified the `handleProcess()` function in `/src/pages/HomeworkPage.tsx` to:

1. **Load Fresh API Key**: Before checking if the API key exists, the function now calls `getUserApiKey(user.id, 'gemini')` to get a fresh copy from the database/localStorage
2. **Update State**: If a fresh key is found, it updates the state for future use
3. **Use Fresh Key**: The function uses the fresh `currentApiKey` variable instead of the stale state
4. **Fallback**: If no fresh key is found, it falls back to the state variable as a backup

### Code Changes

**Before:**
```typescript
// Used stale apiKey state directly
if (!apiKey) {
  console.error('❌ No Gemini API key found in DATABASE!');
  // ... show error
}

// Used stale apiKey in API call
const url = `...?key=${apiKey}`;
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Load fresh API key from database/localStorage
let currentApiKey = apiKey;
const freshKey = await getUserApiKey(user.id, 'gemini');
if (freshKey) {
  currentApiKey = freshKey;
  setApiKey(freshKey); // Update state for future use
}

if (!currentApiKey) {
  console.error('❌ No Gemini API key found!');
  // ... show error
}

// Use fresh currentApiKey in API call
const url = `...?key=${currentApiKey}`;
```

## Benefits

1. **Eliminates Stale State**: The button always checks for the latest API key from storage
2. **No Page Reload Required**: Users can add their API key in settings and immediately use it without refreshing the homework page
3. **Better UX**: More reliable detection of API keys
4. **Maintains Backward Compatibility**: Still falls back to state if fresh key loading fails

## Testing

To verify the fix:

1. ✅ User can add Gemini API key in `/api-settings`
2. ✅ Return to `/homework` page without refreshing
3. ✅ Upload an image and click "Analyze with AI"
4. ✅ Button should now detect the API key correctly and proceed with analysis
5. ✅ No "api is not present" error should appear
