- Transform calculations
- Material property updates
- Scene serialization/deserialization
- Molecule template generation

## Deployment Notes

### Build
```bash
npm run build
```
- Build succeeds with no errors
- Bundle size increased by ~1MB (Three.js)
- Lazy loading keeps initial bundle smaller

### Environment
- No environment variables needed for 3D
- Font file must be in `/public/fonts/`
- Works on all major browsers with WebGL 2.0

### Performance Considerations
- Consider CDN for Three.js in production
- Enable gzip compression for large bundles
- Monitor bundle size if adding more features
- Use code splitting for additional molecules

The 3D interactive whiteboard feature has been successfully implemented with comprehensive functionality covering:
- ✅ 3D rendering and camera controls
- ✅ Multiple object types (shapes, text, molecules)
- ✅ Full material system with 6 material types
- ✅ Object manipulation and property editing
- ✅ Pre-built molecular structures
- ✅ Scene persistence (save/load)
- ✅ Responsive UI with helpful guidance
- ✅ Mobile support with touch controls
