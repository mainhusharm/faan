# ✅ No build errors
# ⚠️ Warning about chunk size (expected, not critical)
```

### Type Checking
```bash
npx tsc --noEmit
# ✅ No TypeScript errors
# ✅ All types properly defined
```

### Linting
```bash
npm run lint
# ✅ All Diagram3D components pass linting
# ✅ No unused imports or variables in new code
```

### Development Server

```

## Acceptance Criteria Met

From the original ticket, all requirements are satisfied:

1. ✅ Three.js and React Three Fiber properly installed
2. ✅ 3D canvas renders with WebGL (not 2D canvas)
3. ✅ Can clearly see 3D perspective and depth
4. ✅ Camera orbit controls work with mouse
5. ✅ Can add 3D cube and see it in 3D space
6. ✅ Can add 3D sphere and see it's round from all angles
7. ✅ Can add 3D text and rotate around it
8. ✅ Can add molecule (e.g., water) with 3D atoms and bonds
9. ✅ Grid floor or axis helper shows 3D orientation
10. ✅ Lighting creates realistic shading

3. ✅ Rotate view with mouse - see demo objects from different angles
4. ✅ Click "Add Cube" → see 3D cube appear
5. ✅ Rotate around cube - see all 6 faces

8. ✅ Edit object properties in real-time
9. ✅ Save and load complex scenes
10. ✅ Create educational diagrams for chemistry, physics, math

## Demo Scene on Load

To showcase the 3D capability immediately, three demo objects are created:

1. **Blue Cube** at position (-1.5, 0.5, 0) - rotated to show perspective
2. **Orange Sphere** at position (0, 0.5, 0) - shows spherical geometry
3. **Green Cylinder** at position (1.5, 0.5, 0) - demonstrates cylindrical shape

All visible from default camera position [5, 5, 5] with auto-rotate enabled.

## Molecular Structures Included

Pre-built molecules with accurate geometry:

1. **Water (H₂O)** - V-shaped, 104.5° bond angle
2. **Methane (CH₄)** - Tetrahedral, 109.5° bond angles
3. **Ethanol (C₂H₅OH)** - Alcohol with accurate bond structure
4. **Benzene (C₆H₆)** - Hexagonal aromatic ring with alternating bonds

Each molecule uses CPK coloring:
- Hydrogen (H): White (#FFFFFF)
- Carbon (C): Black (#000000)
- Oxygen (O): Red (#FF0D0D)
- Nitrogen (N): Blue (#3050F8)

## Browser Compatibility
