- ✅ Cylinder - cylindrical shape
- ✅ Cone - conical shape
- ✅ Torus - donut shape
- ✅ Pyramid - tetrahedral shape
- ✅ All shapes have proper 3D geometry
- ✅ Different default colors via material properties

#### 3D Molecules
- ✅ "Add Molecule" button in toolbar
- ✅ Dropdown/dialog with common molecules
- ✅ Water (H₂O) - V-shaped molecule
- ✅ Methane (CH₄) - tetrahedral structure
- ✅ Ethanol (C₂H₅OH) - alcohol molecule
- ✅ Benzene (C₆H₆) - aromatic ring
- ✅ Ball-and-stick model (spheres for atoms, cylinders for bonds)
- ✅ Color-coded atoms:
  - O = red (#FF0D0D)
  - H = white (#FFFFFF)
  - C = black (#000000)
  - N = blue (#3050F8)

### 6. 3D Camera Controls
- ✅ **Mouse orbit** - click and drag to rotate camera around scene
- ✅ **Scroll zoom** - mouse wheel to zoom in/out
- ✅ **Pan** - OrbitControls with damping
- ✅ **Reset camera button** to return to default view
- ✅ Controls feel smooth and responsive (dampingFactor: 0.05)
- ✅ Auto-rotate option (enabled by default)

### 7. Object Manipulation
- ✅ Click to select 3D objects
- ✅ Highlight selected (green wireframe outline)
- ✅ Properties panel showing object details:
  - Position (X, Y, Z)
  - Rotation (X, Y, Z in radians)
  - Scale (X, Y, Z)
  - Material properties (type, color, opacity, metalness, roughness)
  - Object-specific properties (text, element, etc.)
- ✅ Delete button to remove selected object
- ✅ Duplicate button to copy objects

### 8. Visual Confirmation
- ✅ Grid floor shows depth
- ✅ Axis helper shows orientation (X=red, Y=green, Z=blue)
- ✅ Shadows enabled (directional light with castShadow)
- ✅ Multiple demo objects at different depths
- ✅ Lighting creates depth perception:
  - Ambient light (base illumination)
  - Directional lights (main, fill, rim)
  - Hemisphere light (sky/ground)
- ✅ 3D perspective clearly visible

### 9. Verification Tests
- ✅ Can SEE 3D perspective (not flat 2D)
- ✅ Can rotate camera with mouse
- ✅ Can add 3D cube and see all 6 faces
- ✅ Can add 3D text and rotate around it
- ✅ Can add molecule and see atoms in 3D space
- ✅ Objects have depth and perspective
- ✅ Lighting creates shadows/shading
- ✅ Works on desktop browsers

## 🎯 Additional Enhancements

### Demo Scene
- ✅ Three initial objects (cube, sphere, cylinder) on load
- ✅ Different colors for each demo object
- ✅ Positioned at different X coordinates to show depth
- ✅ Rotated cube to show 3D perspective

### User Experience
- ✅ Auto-rotate enabled by default to showcase 3D
- ✅ Comprehensive properties panel
- ✅ Molecule picker dialog
- ✅ Save/Load scene functionality
- ✅ Export image capability

### Code Quality
- ✅ TypeScript types for all components
- ✅ Functional state updates for performance
- ✅ No TypeScript compilation errors
- ✅ Fixed all linting errors in 3D components
- ✅ Optimized callbacks with useCallback

### Documentation
- ✅ Comprehensive user guide (3D_WHITEBOARD_GUIDE.md)
- ✅ Feature documentation
- ✅ Usage instructions
- ✅ Troubleshooting guide
