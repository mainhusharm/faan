4. **Error Detection**: Lists any errors or misconceptions in the diagram
5. **Suggestions**: Constructive improvement recommendations
6. **Explanation**: Comprehensive educational explanation of the concept
7. **Related Topics**: List of related concepts to explore
8. **Scoring**: Correctness and completeness scores (0-1 scale)

#### Processing Pipeline
1. **Canvas Capture**: Convert drawing to high-resolution PNG
2. **Image Encoding**: Base64 encoding for API transmission
3. **AI Processing**: Gemini Vision API analysis
4. **Response Parsing**: Extract JSON from AI response (handles markdown code blocks)

- Separate rendering for different tool types
- Proper canvas context management
- Composite operations for eraser tool

#### API Key Management
- Integrates with existing encrypted API key system
- Loads from localStorage for instant access
- Background sync with Supabase database
- Fallback to cached keys if database unavailable

### 8. Error Handling
- Comprehensive error messages for:
  - Missing API key
  - Empty canvas analysis attempts
  - API failures
  - Image conversion errors
  - JSON parsing errors
- User-friendly error display with icons
- Clear call-to-action for resolution

### 9. Responsive Design
- Mobile-friendly tool palette with wrapping
- Touch-optimized canvas interaction
- Proper touch event handling (`touchstart`, `touchmove`, `touchend`)
- Palm rejection via CSS `touch-action: none`
- Adaptive layout for small screens
