```

## Configuration

### API Key Setup

**Option 1: Environment Variable (Global)**
Add to `.env`:
```env
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
```

**Option 2: User Settings (Per-User)**
1. Navigate to Settings → API Keys
2. Add Gemini API key
3. Stored encrypted in `user_api_keys` table

**Priority:** User key > Environment variable

### Get Gemini API Key
1. Visit https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
2. Sign in with Google account
3. Create API key
4. Copy and paste in settings or `.env`

## User Flow

### Complete Workflow
1. User navigates to Homework page
2. User uploads image (camera or file)
3. (Optional) User edits image (crop, rotate, adjust)
4. User clicks "Get AI Solution"
5. System validates API key
6. Image uploaded to Supabase storage
7. Upload record created in database
8. Image sent to Gemini Vision API
9. AI analyzes and generates solution
10. Analysis and solution saved to database
11. Solution displayed to user
12. User can view history, re-view solutions

## Error Handling

### Comprehensive Error Messages
- Invalid API key → "Please check your settings"
- API quota exceeded → "Try again later or check limits"
- JSON parsing error → "Try again with clearer image"
- Database error → "Check connection and try again"
- Network error → Generic fallback message

### User Feedback
- Loading states with progress indicators
- Educational tips during processing
- Status transitions with visual feedback
- Error displays with retry options
- Success confirmation

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization
- Image converted to base64 for API transmission
- Supabase storage for permanent image storage
- Database indexing on user_id and upload_id
- Lazy loading of homework history
- Efficient JSON response parsing

### Typical Processing Time
- Upload: 1-3 seconds
- Analysis: 10-30 seconds (Gemini API)
- Total: 15-35 seconds

## Security

### API Key Management
- User API keys encrypted with base64 (demo - use proper encryption in production)
- Row-level security on database tables
- User authentication required
- API keys never exposed to client

### File Upload Security
- File type validation (JPEG, PNG, HEIC, PDF)
- File size limit (10MB)
- Secure storage bucket with proper permissions
- User-specific file paths
