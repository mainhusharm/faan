### Environment Variables
No additional environment variables needed beyond existing Supabase configuration.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"API Key Required" Warning**
   - Configure Gemini API key in Settings
   - Navigate to `/api-settings`
   - Add key under "Google Gemini API"

2. **Upload Fails**
   - Check file size (max 10MB)
   - Verify file format (JPEG, PNG, HEIC, PDF)
   - Ensure stable internet connection

3. **Processing Stuck**
   - Check API key is valid
   - Verify Supabase connection
   - Check browser console for errors

4. **Solution Not Displaying**
   - Refresh page
   - Check upload status in History tab
   - Verify database records created

## Performance Considerations
