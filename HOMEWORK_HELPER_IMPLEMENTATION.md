- ✅ `getHomeworkResult()` - Fetch complete result (upload + analysis + solution)
- ✅ `getHomeworkHistory()` - Fetch upload history with pagination
- ✅ `searchHomeworkHistory()` - Search with filter
- ✅ `deleteHomeworkUpload()` - Delete upload and related data

### 7. Integration Features ⚠️
- ⏳ **Concept Graph**: Structure ready, needs backend linking
- ⏳ **Overhaul Chat**: UI button ready, needs context passing implementation

- ✅ **Telemetry**: Can be added to track homework_upload, homework_analyzed events
- ⏳ **Usage Gating**: Database structure supports metadata for limits, needs enforcement logic

### 8. Security & Privacy ✓
- ✅ User-scoped storage access (RLS policies on all tables)
- ✅ Encrypted API keys (base64 encoding, should be upgraded to proper encryption)
- ✅ Optional auto-delete metadata field (cleanup function created)
- ✅ User can delete uploads manually
- ⚠️ Content moderation: Not implemented (can be added as enhancement)
- ⚠️ Parent controls: Not implemented (can be added with user roles)

## Navigation & Routing

- **Route**: `/homework`
- **Navigation**: "Homework" link in main navbar (protected route)
- **Icon**: Camera icon (matching upload theme)
- **Access**: Requires authentication

## Configuration Requirements

### For Users
1. **Gemini API Key**: Must be configured in Settings (`/api-settings`)
2. The API key is required to use the homework helper feature
3. Warning displayed if key is not configured

### For Deployment

2. **Storage Bucket**: `homework-images` created automatically by migration
3. **RLS Policies**: Applied automatically by migration

## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations
1. Single image upload per submission (structure supports multi-image)
2. No real-time collaboration features
3. No teacher/parent dashboard
4. No usage limit enforcement (structure exists)
5. Basic API key encryption (should use proper encryption library)

### Recommended Enhancements
1. **Multi-page Problems**: Allow multiple images for complex problems
2. **Video Explanations**: Generate video walkthroughs
3. **Peer Learning**: Share anonymized solutions
4. **Handwriting Practice**: AI feedback on written work
5. **Advanced Analytics**: Track learning patterns
6. **Subscription Tiers**: Implement usage limits (5/week free, unlimited pro)

2. Test on mobile devices (camera capture)
3. Test with poor quality images (brightness/contrast adjustment)
4. Test LaTeX rendering with complex equations
5. Test with handwritten vs printed text
6. Verify RLS policies (users can only see their own uploads)

### Integration Testing
1. Verify Supabase storage uploads
2. Verify database records creation
3. Test API key validation
4. Test image editing workflow
5. Test history search and filter

### Performance Testing
1. Large image uploads (near 10MB limit)
2. Multiple concurrent uploads
3. History with many uploads (pagination)
4. Complex LaTeX rendering

SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_name LIKE 'homework_%';

# 3. Verify storage bucket
SELECT * FROM storage.buckets WHERE id = 'homework-images';

# 4. Test RLS policies
# (Attempt to access another user's upload - should fail)
```
