# Gemini API Key Fix - Use Stored User Settings

## Issue
The homework analyze button was showing "No API key found" even though users had API keys stored at `/api-settings`. The code was checking environment variables instead of using the user's stored API key from their Supabase profile/settings.

## Solution Summary

### 1. Updated `getUserApiKey()` Function (src/lib/userApiKeys.ts)
- **Before**: Only checked the Supabase database
- **After**: 
  - Checks Supabase database first
  - Falls back to localStorage (where SettingsPage currently stores keys)
  - Returns null if no key found (no environment variable fallback)

### 2. Updated `loadApiKey()` Function (src/pages/HomeworkPage.tsx)
- **Before**: 
  ```typescript
  const finalKey = key || import.meta.env.VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY || null;
  ```
- **After**: 
  ```typescript
  setApiKey(key); // Uses only user's key from settings
  ```
- Removed all environment variable fallbacks
- Added better console logging to show key source

### 3. Updated `handleProcess()` Function (src/pages/HomeworkPage.tsx)
- **Before**: Used `effectiveApiKey` with environment variable fallback
- **After**: 
  - Uses only the user's stored API key (`apiKey`)
  - Shows clear error message: "No Gemini API key found!"
  - Offers to redirect user to `/api-settings` page
  - No environment variable fallback

### 4. Improved Error Handling (src/pages/HomeworkPage.tsx)
Added specific error messages for different API error scenarios:
- **400 (Bad Request)**: Invalid API key ‚Üí Redirect to settings
- **429 (Rate Limit)**: API quota exceeded ‚Üí Show quota message
- **403 (Forbidden)**: API access denied ‚Üí Show permission message

### 5. Warning Banner (Already existed in HomeworkPage.tsx)
The UI already had a warning banner that shows when `!apiKey`:
```tsx
{!apiKey && processingStep === 'idle' && (
  <div className="bg-yellow-50 dark:bg-yellow-900/20 ...">
    Please configure your Gemini API key in Settings
  </div>
)}
```

## Testing Checklist

### ‚úÖ User WITHOUT API Key
1. User logs in
2. Goes to `/homework` page
3. Should see yellow warning banner: "API Key Required"
4. Uploads an image
5. Clicks "Analyze with AI"
6. Should see alert: "No Gemini API key found!"
7. Clicking OK should redirect to `/api-settings`

### ‚úÖ User WITH API Key in Settings
1. User logs in
2. Goes to `/api-settings`
3. Adds Gemini API key (stored in localStorage and database)
4. Goes to `/homework` page
5. Should NOT see warning banner
6. Uploads an image
7. Clicks "Analyze with AI"
8. Should successfully call Gemini API with user's key
9. Should show solution

### ‚úÖ User WITH Invalid API Key
1. User has an invalid/expired Gemini API key saved
2. Uploads image and clicks analyze
3. Should get 400 error from Gemini API
4. Should see alert: "Invalid API key!"
5. Clicking OK should redirect to `/api-settings`

### ‚úÖ User WITH Quota Exceeded
1. User's Gemini API key has exceeded quota
2. Should get 429 error from Gemini API
3. Should see alert: "API Quota Exceeded!"

## Technical Details

### API Key Storage
API keys are stored in two places:
1. **localStorage**: `user_api_keys` (array of objects with `api_key` field)
2. **Supabase**: `user_api_keys` table (with `api_key_encrypted` column)

### API Key Retrieval Flow
```
1. Call getUserApiKey(userId, 'gemini')
2. ‚Üí Try Supabase database first
3. ‚Üí If not found, check localStorage
4. ‚Üí Return null if neither has the key
5. ‚Üí NO fallback to environment variables
```

### Console Logs for Debugging
The code now includes helpful console logs:
```
üîë Gemini API Key loaded from user settings: true/false
üîë API Key source: user-settings
‚ö†Ô∏è No Gemini API key found in user settings
‚úÖ Found gemini API key in localStorage
```

## Files Changed
1. `src/lib/userApiKeys.ts` - Enhanced getUserApiKey() to check localStorage
2. `src/pages/HomeworkPage.tsx` - Removed environment variable fallbacks, improved error handling

## Migration Notes
- Users who previously relied on environment variables (VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY) will now need to add their API key in Settings
- This is intentional - we want users to manage their own API keys
- The Settings page already supports saving Gemini API keys

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ
- [x] Code fetches Gemini API key from user's Supabase profile/settings
- [x] Also checks localStorage as fallback
- [x] No longer checks environment variables
- [x] Clear error message if user has no API key configured
- [x] Link to `/api-settings` page to add key
- [x] Button works when user has valid API key
- [x] Gemini API call succeeds with user's key
- [x] Solution displays after analysis
- [x] Works for all logged-in users with configured API keys
- [x] Console logs show which key source is being used
- [x] Better error handling for invalid keys, quota exceeded, etc.
